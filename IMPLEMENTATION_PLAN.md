# IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md - Video Privacy Editor

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive, step-by-step implementation strategy for the Video Privacy Editor system. The plan follows a dependency-driven approach, building from foundational components to complete functionality while maintaining testability and quality at each stage.

## Implementation Strategy

### Core Philosophy
- **Bottom-Up Approach**: Build foundational layers first (core → utils → storage → detection → processing → web)
- **Incremental Development**: Each phase produces working, testable components
- **Validation-First**: Implement comprehensive validation and error handling from the start
- **Test-Driven**: Write tests alongside implementation, not as an afterthought
- **Documentation-Driven**: Update documentation as implementation progresses

### Dependency Analysis

```
Web Module
    ↓
Processing Module ← Detection Module
    ↓                 ↓
Storage Module ←------┘
    ↓
Utils Module
    ↓
Core Module (Foundation)
```

**Rationale**: This order ensures each module can be fully implemented and tested before dependent modules are built.

## Alternative Implementation Approaches

### Alternative 1: Detection-First Approach
**Pros**: Earlier validation of core detection algorithms  
**Cons**: No storage layer for testing, harder to validate results  
**Verdict**: Less optimal due to testing difficulties

### Alternative 2: Web-First Approach  
**Pros**: Earlier user feedback, visible progress  
**Cons**: No backend functionality to demonstrate, unstable foundation  
**Verdict**: Risky without solid backend foundation

### Alternative 3: Parallel Development
**Pros**: Faster overall development  
**Cons**: Integration complexity, dependency conflicts  
**Verdict**: Good for larger teams, risky for solo development

## Recommended Approach: Sequential Bottom-Up

The proposed **Core → Utils → Storage → Detection → Processing → Web** approach is optimal because:

1. **Solid Foundation**: Each layer provides stable APIs for the next
2. **Testability**: Components can be thoroughly tested before use
3. **Risk Reduction**: Major architectural issues discovered early
4. **Clear Dependencies**: No circular dependencies or integration surprises
5. **Incremental Value**: Each phase produces working, valuable components

This approach ensures a stable, maintainable system built on proven foundations, with comprehensive testing and documentation at each stage.
